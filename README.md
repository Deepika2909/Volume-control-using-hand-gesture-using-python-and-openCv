VOLUME CONTROL USING HAND GESTURE USING PYTHON AND OPENCV
This project implements a volume control system using hand gestures through Python and OpenCV. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the system detects hand gestures captured through a webcam and adjusts the volume accordingly.

KEY FEATURES
Gesture Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV for hand gesture recognition. It detects predefined hand gestures to control the volume level.
Real-time Processing: Provides real-time processing capabilities, allowing instantaneous adjustment of volume based on detected gestures.
Dynamic Volume Control: Offers dynamic volume control, where the volume level changes based on the position or movement of the hand.
User-friendly Interface: Implements an intuitive interface to visualize the detected hand gestures and the corresponding volume adjustments.
Cross-platform Compatibility: Ensures compatibility across different platforms, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
